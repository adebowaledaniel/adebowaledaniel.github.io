Introduction
===

The point cloud data already came with two classification, Ground(Brown) and Unclassified(Grey) as seen in the figure 5 below. A  closer observation of the unclassified shows that it includes vegetation and infrastructure (for example, building and Bridge); therefore in this exercises a binary classification for  vegetation and buildings is executed using the CANUPO plugin in Cloudcompare.

First the unclassified is separated from the ground class using the classification scalaer value.
