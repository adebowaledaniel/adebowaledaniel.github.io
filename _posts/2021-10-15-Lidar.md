Overview
===
The objective of this exercise is to perform an advanced operation in Cloudcompare; the goal here is to perform a binary semantic classification
using multiscale dimensionality.  

Study Area and Data
===
The area of interest is Queens Towns, New Zealand; the choice of the AOI was base on data availability.

Queens Towns, New Zealand.

The point cloud data (Queenstown 2016) used is obtain from the OpenTopography; the data and its description can be openly accessed [here](https://portal.opentopography.org/lidarDataset?opentopoID=OTLAS.012019.2193.1). The point cloud data already came with two classification, Ground(Brown) and Unclassified(Yellow) as seen in the figure below. A closer observation of the unclassified shows that it includes vegetation and infrastructure (for example, building and Bridge); therefore in this exercises a binary semantic classification for vegetation and buildings is executed using the CANUPO plugin in Cloudcompare.

Methodolody
====
To achieve the goal of this exercise, the *Unclassified* was separated from the *Ground* using the **Classification Scalar Values**.

**Train Sample Selection**  
Asforementioned, this binary classifcation is aimed further semantically separate the unclassified into Vegetation and Buildings. The sample selection process is very cruicial as it involve logical selection of point cloud with respect to their semantic representation in 3D of the two target classes. One of the precautions taken was to aviod noise/point cloud mixture of the target classes. For example, figure 1 & 2 represent sample for vegetation and building selected respectively, they were observed from different perspective to ensure possible mixture.
