Overview
======

Integrated within the [Copernicus Master in Digital Earth](https://www.master-cde.eu/) curriculum is a compulsory internship, with the intent toward students gaining industrial and research experience in the geospatial and Earth observation domain.  

My internship tenure at FAO focused on contributing to the existing projects under the [United Nations Decade on Ecosystem Restoration](https://www.decadeonrestoration.org/), in close collaboration with the different teams involved in Land and Water Management, geospatial data management and analysis within the organisation scope.

The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration is led by the United Nations Environment Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations; it calls for the protection and revival of the ecosystems, which also strongly aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals.

One of the Decade's strategies is the [Framework for Ecosystem Restoration Monitoring (FERM)](https://www.fao.org/national-forest-monitoring/ferm/en/#:~:text=As%20outlined%20in%20the%20Decade's,countries%2C%20under%20one%20common%20umbrella%2C), which pioneered the development of open-access tools, data and methodological guidance in tracking the progressive efforts towards restoring degraded ecosystems. Mentioned tools; the SDG indicator module developed by the team at FAO is currently available for only SDG 15.3.1.

This page summarised my internship experience and some tasks assigned.

Task objective and description
---

- Assessment of restoration activities in Nigeria

---
 In responses to the SDG Indicator 15.3.1, i.e. "measures the proportion of land that is degraded over total land area". The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) developed [Good Practice Guidance](http://www2.unccd.int/sites/default/files/relevant-links/2017-10/Good%20Practice%20Guidance_SDG%20Indicator%2015.3.1_Version%201.0.pdf) on calculating the extent of land degradation for reporting SDG 15.3.1. Three sub-indicators: Vegetation productivity, Land cover, and Soil organic carbon, are further specified. Each sub-indicator is observed and computed spatially over time, leveraging on the Spatio-temporal characteristics of satellite images.
Towards accomplishing this task, some parameters are supplied, such as the area of interest, baseline and target year, satellite sensor (Landsat mission, Modis and Sentinel 2), vegetation index, etc. This process integrates a temporal pixel-wise comparison of all the sub-indicators, resulting in estimation and indication of potential land degradation, stability, or improvement regarding the positive or negative significate trends. The SDG 15.3.1 indicator results are finally presented in maps (Figure 1) and tables (Area in km2).

- SEPAL SDG indicators module

---
Using several case studies as described previously, I contributed to developing the SDG indicator module. The SDG 15.3.1 module is built on [SEPAL](https://sepal.io/), one of the Free Open-source Solutions for environmental monitoring ([Openforis](https://openforis.org/)); its methodology follows the good practice guidance by the UNCCD and is implemented in consultation with the [trends.earth](https://trends.earth/) team at Conservation International. This tool is developed for Governments, institutions and individuals to generate data for reporting on SDG indicators at national and local levels.
The task here was to compare and interpret both visually (maps) and quantitatively the output from both platforms while using a different set of parameters.

- Framework for Ecosystem Restoration Monitoring (FERM) Database

---
This entails research on existing frameworks and strategies at international, regional, and national on reporting ecosystem restoration monitoring, especially the metrics categorised on goals, targets, criteria, and indicators. The database is intended to extract a list of prioritised indicators; to further develop open access to methodological guidance and tools to monitor ecosystem restoration, enabling knowledge and technology transfer, capacity development, monitoring and reporting by any interested individual worldwide.
To enrich the database further, available geospatial datasets (open and free) for the indicators are integrated with the existing large dataset pool on the FERM geospatial platform: [FAO Hand-in-Hand initiative](https://data.apps.fao.org/ferm/).

Lesson Learned
---

- Active topics and activities in global Land Degradation Neutrality,
- The essence and methods of Earth observation analysis products (such NDVI, Land cover dataset, etc.) in estimating land productivity,
- Importance of operational earth observation datasets.
