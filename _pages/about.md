I am a MSc student of [Copernicus Master in Digital Earth](https://www.master-cde.eu/); first year (Earth Observation and Geoinformatics) in the [University of Salzburg](https://www.plus.ac.at/?lang=en), Austria and currently studying GeoData Science (second year) in the [University of Southern Brittany](https://www.univ-ubs.fr/en/index.html), France.

Prior to this, I had my first degree in Remote Sensing and GIS at the [Federal University of Technology Akure](https://futa.edu.ng/), Nigeria.

My interests focus on applying Earth Observation data, Geospatial Technologies and Artificial Intelligence to agriculture and food security, natural disaster and related environmental issues.
