**Topic :** Deep domain adaptation techniques for multi-temporal change detection.  

Superviors: Dr Charlotte Pelletier (IRISA/UBS), Prof. Stefan Lang (Z_GIS/PLUS) and Dr Silvia Valero (CESBIO/Uni. Toulouse III)  

**Keywords:** satellite image time series, Sentinel-2, temporal domain adaptation, deep learning, self-attention mechanism.  

 My research is divided into the following tasks:  

 1. performing a comprehensive review on change detection and temporal unsupervised domain adaptation techniques;  
 2. extracting  two  Sentinel-2  SITS  and  gathering  ground  truth  data  from  French  Land Parcel Information System;  
 3. assessing the accuracy of two baseline change maps:  (i) obtained by computing the difference between the two land cover maps obtained by fully-supervised learning algorithms when reference data are available for the two years, and (ii) obtained by computing the difference between the two land cover maps obtained by a model trained for one year;  
 4. proposing novel approaches based on temporal domain adaptation to improve the landcover change maps obtained in the two settings.
