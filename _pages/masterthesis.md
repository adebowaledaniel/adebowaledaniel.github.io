**Topic :** Land use land cover change detection from Sentinel-2 image time series using deep learning techiniques.  

Superviors: Dr Charlotte Pelletier (UBS), Prof. Stefan Lang (PLUS) and Dr Silvia Valero (CESBIOCESBIO/Uni. Toulouse III)  

**Keywords:** satellite image time series, Sentinel-2, temporal domain adaptation, deep learning, self-attention mechanism.  

 My research is divided into the following tasks:  

 1. performing a comprehensive review on change detection and temporal unsuperviseddomain adaptation techniques;  
 2. extracting  two  Sentinel-2  SITS  and  gathering  ground  truth  data  from  French  LandParcel Information System;  
 3. assessing the accuracy of two baseline change maps:  (i) obtained by computing thedifference between the two land cover maps obtained by fully-supervised learning algo-rithms when reference data are available for the two years, and (ii) obtained by com-puting the difference between the two land cover maps obtained by a model trainedfor one year;  
 4. proposing novel approaches based on temporal domain adaptation to improve the landcover change maps obtained in the two settings.
